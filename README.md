# Array Data Structures
Week 1 CISC 187
 (Including answers from main.cpp here as well for ease of locating)

Task 1:
To create an array of 100 elements in C++ you need to declare a datatype (int, double, char, etc.), followed by an identifiable name (much like with a standard variable), attach square brackets to the name, and within the brackets declare a size for the array. In this case 100. 

Task 2:
The size of each element in an array depends on the context, I will give two approaches.
Firstly, each index of the array can contain an integer, by that definition, each element takes up exactly
one index "spot", [0], [1], [2]...etc.
Secondly, the size of an element is also dependent on the data type used, in this case integer. An integer is typically 4 bytes, however we can clarify this with the standard library function sizeof(), which I have called in main.

Task 3 (Number of steps for the following operations):

Reading:

Searching for a value not contained within the array:

Insertion at the beginning of the array:

Insertion at the end of the array:

Deletion at the beginning of the array:

Deletion at the end of the array:
